# Student-Course-Management-System
### Java backend and Mysql database with no framework used like spring or spring boot

This application is created for our class members Where there are a set of courses we can enroll in.
A student can enroll all the courses but not a course which he already enrolled, It is more related to backend not frontend oriented.

##Error Handling
All of the errors are handled properly which increased the robustness, I believe that error handling is the 70% of work which makes our application work in some uncertainity.

##Steps If you are outsider to verify the working
###Outsider Roll-Number : Teja12 (use this in the roll no field)

1. I have not deployed my backend anywhere I made my own devece as a server, So If it keeps saying Loading then you can just close the close application because I will turn them only when I need it (you can contat me from any of the socual media platforms If not working then I will respond to you).

2. Simply follow the application once open that's it

####Note:: "Teja123 is for the outsiders"

Build Tool used is Maven
